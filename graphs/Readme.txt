explanation of the graphs:

the accuracy is the loss ~approximitely 2.x million

32000 graph increases at increments of 100
9000 increases at increments of 10
2500 = increments of 3
*did not go by the mutiple 2's , but img3_super_zoomed is interesting


img3:
imput size changes from 16 -> x = {32000, 9000, 2500}
feature size = 1
decoder_int = 8
seed = 116 (the best seed i found for accuracy; tested seeds 1 - 200)

feature4:
imput size changes from 16 -> x = {32000, 9000, 2500}
feature size = 4
decoder_int = 8
seed = 116 (the best seed i found for accuracy; tested seeds 1 - 200)
